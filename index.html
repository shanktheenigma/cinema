            "The Manson Murders is a chilling and thought-provoking documentary that delves deep into the dark legacy of Charles Manson and the 1969 Tate-LaBianca murders. Based on investigative journalist Tom O’Neill’s explosive book, the film challenges the official story told for decades — revealing shocking connections between Manson, law enforcement, and possible CIA mind control experiments. As new evidence emerges and interviews with key witnesses unfold, the film uncovers disturbing questions about corruption, manipulation, and the hidden history of the 1960s counterculture. More than just a true crime story, Chaos is a journey into the heart of American paranoia, secrecy, and institutional betrayal.",

Encouraged by his mother who was once passed over for Amah’s inheritance M strategically moves in with his grandmother, faking compassion and concern. At first, his motives are purely selfish. But as M spends more time with Amah, witnessing her daily routines, stubborn pride, and quiet loneliness, his feelings start to shift. What begins as a cold-hearted plan turns into a journey of unexpected love and emotional growth. M slowly discovers the true meaning of family, sacrifice, and dignity, especially as Amah’s condition worsens. Tensions rise with relatives who also have their eyes on the inheritance, exposing family dysfunction and generational disconnects. Ultimately, M is forced to choose between material gain and genuine human connection with a bittersweet twist that tests his conscience and transforms him forever.",
